[v1.4] 2021.03.07

    * NEW: Modern `match()` method for ESS implementation with bitwise options:
            ```
            bool match(const tstring& input, const tstring& pattern, const EngineOptions& options, MatchResult* result);
            ```
            Searches an input string for a substring that matches a pattern.
            Use F_ICASE = 0x001 to ignore case sensitivity when matching.
          
    * NEW: Implemented `>c` metasymbol.
           Modern `>` as [^c]*str | [^c]*$
           
           This is default behavior using match().
           To activate legacy `>` as [^/]*str | [^/]*$ use F_LEGACY_ANYSP = 0x080
           
    * NEW: Implemented F_MATCH_RESULT = 0x002 flag to collect additional data for the MatchResult.
            ```
            EssRxW::MatchResult m;
            rxw.match
            (
                _T("number = '8888'; //TODO: up"),
                _T("'+'"),
                EssRxW::EngineOptions::F_MATCH_RESULT,
                &m
            );
            //m.start = 9
            //m.end = 15
            ```
    
    * NEW: Added `replace()` method for ESS implementation.
            ```
            bool replace(tstring& input, const tstring& pattern, const tstring& replacement, const EngineOptions& options);
            ```
            In a specified input, replaces first substring that match a specified pattern with a specified replacement string.
            
    * NEW: Implemented optional offset for `match()` and `replace()` methods. ESS impl.
            ```
            bool replace(tstring& input, const tstring& pattern, const tstring& replacement, udiff_t offset, const EngineOptions& options)
            bool match(const tstring& input, const tstring& pattern, udiff_t offset, const EngineOptions& options, MatchResult* result)
            ```
            udiff_t offset - The starting position to start matching.
            
    * NEW: Implemented F_MATCH_ALL = 0x004. Do not finish on first match in replace() method.
    
    * NEW: New C-export functions in common.h PE/Invoke or other outside environments.
           ```
            bool replace(TCHAR* input, const TCHAR* pattern, const TCHAR* replacement, flagcfg_t options);    
            bool replaceOfs(TCHAR* input, const TCHAR* pattern, const TCHAR* replacement, udiff_t offset, flagcfg_t options);    
            bool match(const TCHAR* input, const TCHAR* pattern, flagcfg_t options, EssRxW::MatchResult* result);    
            bool matchOfs(const TCHAR* input, const TCHAR* pattern, udiff_t offset, flagcfg_t options, EssRxW::MatchResult* result);    
            bool replaceTo(const TCHAR* input, const TCHAR* pattern, const TCHAR* replacement, TCHAR* to, udiff_t offset, flagcfg_t options);
           ```
           
    * FIXED: Fixed SINGLE ms for +++ and `system+` or like.
    
    * FIXED: Fixed END ms `$` and BEGIN ms `^` when using other available ms.

    * FIXED: Fixed Compiler Error such C2758 etc for C99/MSVC10 compilers (VS2010).
    
    * FIXED: Fixed NuGet package use for native C/C++ projects.
    
    * CHANGED: Implemented MS combinations for END $ such as *$, ??$, +$.

    * CHANGED: Most our types are spaced now as regXwild::rxwtypes.
    
    * NOTE: You can find various flexible use for .NET in our new dotnet-test project through Conari engine:

[v1.3] 2020.08.10
    
    * NEW: Quantifiers are now standardized as follows:
            https://github.com/3F/regXwild#-quantifiers
            
            regex           | regXwild   | n
            ----------------|------------|---------

    * NEW: Quantifiers. Implemented `++??` support for ranges. Part of PR #7.
            ```
            {n, m} where n > 0 and m > n
            
                n == +
                m == ?
            ```            
            * `++??` (2 - 4)
            * `+???` (1 - 4)
            * `+++?` (3 - 4)
            * `+?`   (1 - 2)
            
            etc. See unit-tests.
    
    * NEW: Quantifiers. Implemented `##??` support for ranges. Part of PR #7.
            ```
            {n, m} where n > 0 and m > n
            
                n == #
                m == ?
            ```

            etc. See unit-tests.
            
    * FIXED: Fixed rewind in MS-split `|` like for '##'|'####'
    
    * FIXED: Fixed errors in second order quantifiers: `?? == .{0, 2}` and `## == .{2}`
             For example:
             * False positive matching `[1####_of` for `TV_[11_of_24]`
             * Crashed `number = '????';` for `number = '123';`
             * and related.
    
    * CHANGED: API versionString() marked as obsolete due to RXWVersion.
    
    
[v1.2] 2020.02.10

    * NEW: MultiByte support.
           Now you can use modules with MultiByte characters.
           
           For C++ projects it will be automatically selected 
           according to the actual project configuration.
           
           For .NET, you need to override related `CharacterSet` property.
           
    * NEW: .NET Core based projects support through Conari and related:
           Including .NET Standard targeting;
           
           Just install our modern NuGet packages;
           https://www.nuget.org/packages/regXwild
    
    * CHANGED: Modules with MultiByte characters for .NET projects by default.
               You can replace this by the changing $(CharacterSet) msbuild property:
               ```
               <CharacterSet>Unicode</CharacterSet>
               ```
               
    * CHANGED: Added the following tools to packages for related build processes.
    
               * tools\gnt.bat - https://github.com/3F/GetNuTool
               * tools\hMSBuild.bat - https://github.com/3F/hMSBuild
               
    * CHANGED: `algo` and `snet` testers can be found inside packages 
                for each $(Platform)-$(CharacterSet)
               
    * CHANGED: Conari will no longer be distributed together with regXwild.
               https://github.com/3F/Conari
               
               Please consider to use it separately. Conari nuget packages:
               https://www.nuget.org/packages/Conari/
               
               (recommended due to caching of 0x29 opcodes and other related optimization)
               
    * NOTE: Offcial releases can be also found through GitHub Releases:
            https://github.com/3F/regXwild/releases
            
            
[v1.1]

    CHANGED: Updated API:
            +REGXWILD_API bool searchEssC(const TCHAR* data, const TCHAR* filter, bool ignoreCase);
            +REGXWILD_API bool searchExtC(const TCHAR* data, const TCHAR* filter, bool ignoreCase);
    
    FIXED: Headers for C linkage and removed REGXWILD_EXPORTS from conf.
    NEW: Added Conari engine for work in .NET
         https://github.com/3F/Conari
         Use our NuGet package for Native C/C++ & .NET projects.
