[v1.2] 2020.02.10

    * NEW: MultiByte support.
           Now you can use modules with MultiByte characters.
           
           For C++ projects it will be automatically selected 
           according to the actual project configuration.
           
           For .NET, you need to override related `CharacterSet` property.
           
    * NEW: .NET Core based projects support through Conari and related:
           Including .NET Standard targeting;
           
           Just install our modern NuGet packages;
           https://www.nuget.org/packages/regXwild
    
    * CHANGED: Modules with MultiByte characters for .NET projects by default.
               You can replace this by the changing $(CharacterSet) msbuild property:
               ```
               <CharacterSet>Unicode</CharacterSet>
               ```
               
    * CHANGED: Added the following tools to packages for related build processes.
    
               * tools\gnt.bat - https://github.com/3F/GetNuTool
               * tools\hMSBuild.bat - https://github.com/3F/hMSBuild
               
    * CHANGED: `algo` and `snet` testers can be found inside packages 
                for each $(Platform)-$(CharacterSet)
               
    * CHANGED: Conari will no longer be distributed together with regXwild.
               https://github.com/3F/Conari
               
               Please consider to use it separately. Conari nuget packages:
               https://www.nuget.org/packages/Conari/
               
               (recommended due to caching of 0x29 opcodes and other related optimization)
               
    * NOTE: Offcial releases can be also found through GitHub Releases:
            https://github.com/3F/regXwild/releases

            +REGXWILD_API bool searchExtC(const TCHAR* data, const TCHAR* filter, bool ignoreCase);
    
    FIXED: Headers for C linkage and removed REGXWILD_EXPORTS from conf.
    NEW: Added Conari engine for work in .NET
         https://github.com/3F/Conari
