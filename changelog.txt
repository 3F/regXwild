[v1.3] 2020.08.10
    
    * NEW: Quantifiers are now standardized as follows:
            https://github.com/3F/regXwild#-quantifiers
            
            regex           | regXwild   | n
            ----------------|------------|---------
            .\*             | \*         | 0+
            .+              | +          | 1+
            .?              | ?          | 0;  1
            .{1}            | #          | 1
            .{2}            | ##         | 2
            .{2, }          | ++         | 2+
            .{0, 2}         | ??         | 0 - 2
            .{2, 4}         | ++??       | 2 - 4
            (?:.{2}\|.{4})  | ##??       | 2;  4
            .{3, 4}         | +++?       | 3 - 4
            (?:.{1}\|.{3})  | #??        | 1;  3
            
    * NEW: Second-order Quantifiers. Added support for `++`
            regex equivalent `.{n, }`
    
    * NEW: Quantifiers. Implemented `++??` support for ranges. Part of PR #7.
            ```
            {n, m} where n > 0 and m > n
            
                n == +
                m == ?
            ```            
            * `++??` (2 - 4)
            * `+???` (1 - 4)
            * `+++?` (3 - 4)
            * `+?`   (1 - 2)
            
            etc. See unit-tests.
    
    * NEW: Quantifiers. Implemented `##??` support for ranges. Part of PR #7.
            ```
            {n, m} where n > 0 and m > n
            
                n == #
                m == ?
            ```
            * `##??` (2 | 4)
            * `#???` (1 | 4)
            * `###?` (3 | 4)
            * `#?`   (1 | 2)
            
            etc. See unit-tests.
            
    * FIXED: Fixed rewind in MS-split `|` like for '##'|'####'
    
    * FIXED: Fixed errors in second order quantifiers: `?? == .{0, 2}` and `## == .{2}`
             For example:
             * False positive matching `[1####_of` for `TV_[11_of_24]`
             * Crashed `number = '????';` for `number = '123';`
             * and related.
    
    * CHANGED: API versionString() marked as obsolete due to RXWVersion.
    
    
[v1.2] 2020.02.10

    * NEW: MultiByte support.
           Now you can use modules with MultiByte characters.
           
           For C++ projects it will be automatically selected 
           according to the actual project configuration.
           
           For .NET, you need to override related `CharacterSet` property.
           
    * NEW: .NET Core based projects support through Conari and related:
           Including .NET Standard targeting;
           
           Just install our modern NuGet packages;
           https://www.nuget.org/packages/regXwild
    
    * CHANGED: Modules with MultiByte characters for .NET projects by default.
               You can replace this by the changing $(CharacterSet) msbuild property:
               ```
               <CharacterSet>Unicode</CharacterSet>
               ```
               
    * CHANGED: Added the following tools to packages for related build processes.
    
               * tools\gnt.bat - https://github.com/3F/GetNuTool
               * tools\hMSBuild.bat - https://github.com/3F/hMSBuild
               
    * CHANGED: `algo` and `snet` testers can be found inside packages 
                for each $(Platform)-$(CharacterSet)
               
    * CHANGED: Conari will no longer be distributed together with regXwild.
               https://github.com/3F/Conari
               
               Please consider to use it separately. Conari nuget packages:
               https://www.nuget.org/packages/Conari/
               
               (recommended due to caching of 0x29 opcodes and other related optimization)
               
    * NOTE: Offcial releases can be also found through GitHub Releases:
            https://github.com/3F/regXwild/releases
            
            
[v1.1]

    CHANGED: Updated API:
            +REGXWILD_API bool searchEssC(const TCHAR* data, const TCHAR* filter, bool ignoreCase);
            +REGXWILD_API bool searchExtC(const TCHAR* data, const TCHAR* filter, bool ignoreCase);
    
    FIXED: Headers for C linkage and removed REGXWILD_EXPORTS from conf.
    NEW: Added Conari engine for work in .NET
         https://github.com/3F/Conari
         Use our NuGet package for Native C/C++ & .NET projects.
